Hello! 
Welcome to rAIcer.

These are the instructions -----------
- Select a track by clicking on one of the buttons under 'Choose a Track:'
- Select a car by clicking on one the buttons under 'Choose a Car:'
- To start the simulation, select the 'Start' button at the bottom the screen
NOTE: If you select start without having a choice selected for the track and car the simulation won't start!


------Basis of this Project---------
This project is to demonstrate to you the user, how an AI model called Reinforcement Learning works. The idea is that
the car(s) you see on the screen are all controlled by AI (The computer). They must use trial and error 
to find whether they should accelerate/turn right/turn left at any point during the Race scene. Every time the computer
crashes/makes a bad move it is 'rewarded' less than if it were to go further round the race course. Therefore there is less
chance of it doing that series of moves the next time it spawns in. Eventually the car(s) should make their way round the
whole track, at which point the simulation ends and you see some interesting statistics about its time taken... etc.


Thank you for playing!
